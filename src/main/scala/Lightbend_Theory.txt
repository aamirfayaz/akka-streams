==What are streams====
--> Streams are sequences of data, divided up into individual elements
--> The size of the stream may not be known, or may be infinite
--> Often streams are too large to fit in memory
    Examples:
    Twitter "firehose" of tweets
    Live video streams
    Data from a fitness tracker

--> Use cases for Streams:
    Consuming Live events (e.g tweets)
    ETL systems (Extract, Transform, Load)
    Streaming media(audio, video)

====Reactive Streams===
--> Reactive Steams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with
    non-blocking back pressure. This encompasses efforts aimed at runtime environments (JVM & JavaScript)
    as well as network protocols

--> Why Reactive Streams?
    How can we consume a stream of data in an asynchronous fashion?
    How can we prevent an asynchronous stream from overwhelming a slow consumer?
    How can we maintain ordering guarantees even while processing things asynchronously?
